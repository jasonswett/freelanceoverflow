# Freelance Overflow
A self-governed network of freelancers who refer each other overflow work, commonly on commision. All members are endorsed by at least three other members of said network and must maintain a stellar track record or risk being kicked out. Members are accepted based upon not only their technical skills, but also their communication skills, project management abilities, and overall professional reputation.

## Processes
### Becoming a Member
Create a pull request with your information added to the member matrix. Once the pull request has been endorsed by at least three members (via comments on said pull request), your pull will be merged and you a full-fledged member of the network.

### Being Kicked Out
If at any point your conduct or work is deemed unsatisfactory, a referring member may request your removal from the network. The referring member should create a pull request with your information removed from the member matrix (along with an explaination). Should at least three members be in support of your removal, the pull request will be accepted and you will no longer be a member of the network.

### Sharing Work
If you don't have a specific member in mind, you can share overflow work via GitHub issues. Each opportunity should be represented as own issue and should contain detailed information about the work, client, commision rate (if any), and any other pertinent information. Members are also encourged to communicate directly with other members, sidestepping the GitHub issues approach, when it makes sense.
