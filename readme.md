# Freelance Overflow ![members](https://img.shields.io/badge/members-3-blue.svg) ![organizers](https://img.shields.io/badge/organizers-1-blue.svg) ![min hourly](https://img.shields.io/badge/hourly min-$100-brightgreen.svg)
An open and self-governed network of technical freelancers who refer each other overflow work. All members are endorsed by at least three other members of said network and must maintain a stellar track record or risk being removed. Members are accepted or declined based upon their technical skills, communication skills, and overall professional reputation.

## Requirements
* __GitHub Presence:__ Members are required to have a strong GitHub commit/issue history to examine. This is the core metric used to gauge your technical skills.
* __Communication Skills:__ Members are required to have solid communication skills. Applicable public social profiles will be examined (e.g. GitHub, Twitter, Hacker News, Dribbble). Additionally, if you do not have at least one member to endorse your interpersonal communication skills, you will be asked to have an informal verbal conversation with an organizer (this is also a chance to network).
* __Minimum Hourly Rates:__ The network does not facilitate racing to the bottom on price. All members are talented developers and the network requires that members have an hourly rate which justifies said talent. This helps ensure that your rates match up with other developers on the network when you refer them work. As such, members are only accepted if they meet the minimum requirement of billing at a rate of __at least__ $100/hr for their own clients.

## Becoming a Member <sub><sup>(Done via Pull Requests)</sup></sub>
To start the process:

* Create a pull request with your information added to the member matrix and the commit description `Added @username as member.`
* In the extended details of your pull request include:
  * Social profiles which allow us to examine your communication style/skills (e.g. Twitter, Hacker News, Dribbble).
  * Lacking a network member who can endorse your interpersonal communication skills, include information about when you can informally speak with an organizer to verify said skills. If you do not have a public email in your GitHub profile, please either specify one or contact an organizer with it.
  * If you have interest in becoming an organizer, please indicate as such.

Once the pull request has been endorsed by at least three members (via comments on said pull request), your pull will be merged and you a full-fledged member of the network.

## Removing a Member <sub><sup>(Done via Pull Requests)</sup></sub>
If at any point a member's conduct/work is deemed unsatisfactory, any referring member may request their removal from the network. To start the process:

* Create a pull request with the offending member's information removed from the member matrix and the commit description `Removed @username as member.`
* In the extended details of your pull request include:
  * A full account of the situation with justification(s) for removal.

Should at least three members be in support of the removal, the pull request will be accepted and the offending member will no longer be part of the network.

## Sharing Work <sub><sup>(Done via Issues)</sup></sub>
If you don't have a specific member in mind, you can share overflow work via GitHub issues. Each opportunity should be represented as its own issue and should contain detailed information about the work, client, commision rate (if any), and any other pertinent information. Members are also encouraged to communicate directly with other members, sidestepping the GitHub issues approach, when it makes sense.
